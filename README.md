# HipBox with Ableton v5.0.1

### Hotfix Branch

This is a full rails + react web application that integrates with Ableton Live to provide an in-ear monitoring system for bands.  This app communicates via OSC streams with max4live plugins.

Since Ableton Live does not run on linux, this app must be run within a virtual box.

## Previous Versions

### v4.0
 - https://github.com/vindennl48/hipbox_v4

### Legacy

Legacy versions were not recorded on github because they were created using other programs and means.  The first few were done with TouchOSC + Bome Midi Translator.  These options worked well for a while, however, my band wanted more functionality than what those programs could offer.
